** [2025-09-02 Tue 22:38] Fucking jobright.ai goes to linkedin which goes to another site

[[file:/Users/oldbones/Projects/job_hunt/cli/extract_job.py::host = parsed_url.netloc]]
* Goals
** Dog food what I need
** SOLID principles
** CLI first
* What does it do?
** can save different versions of a resume
why?
because it's good to taylor your resume
** can save a copy of a job description
why?
because saving it allows things to get tracked
it allows for comparisons to happen without calling the website again or job descriptions
**
* WTF what's the future
** CLI -> API
can call via emacs if I want to
** web UI
more accessible
** access through login
algorithm for each hostname
* Algorithm for each hostname
- when a public url is available
- when a login is required
- when scraping doesn't work
- when the name of the company is only in the URL
